Native-Land (N*)
  The native territory, or natural habitat, of a creature can be quite important to them. Mant dragons are associated with different types of land, as are many creatures. However, if this tag does not apply to you (as it doesn't for many humanoids) then leave it out altogether. A good rule is that if you feel drawn to more than one of the listed land types, you probably don't have a specific native land.
