Reality-Index (R*)
  Your Reality tag measures how serious you are about your on-line identity in real life. This applies to all species, even humans as one can be very serious about their humanity!
    R+++!   I AM as I describe myself, and no-one is going to persuade me otherwise. What you see is what your mind wants you to see!
    R+++    I AM as I describe myself on-line. The human body is either an unfortunate mismatch, an illusion, or just my messenger.
    R++     I tend to answer to my on-line name quicker than my given one. I strongly identify with this form. It would explain a lot if I wasn't really human, but I'm hedging my bets.
    R+      It's a role, but it's a role that's part of my self-image, without which I would feel like something was missing.
    R       I haven't given much thought to whether I am more "real" in human form or in my on-line identity. I'm just me.
    R-      It would be nice to be as I say I am on-line, but I've got some real doubts about whether such a thing is possible.'
    R--     This is a hobby for me. My character is just a product of my imagination, nothing more.
    R---    I consider all of this imaginary. You R+++ people scare me. Don't you think you're taking things a bit too seriously?
    R---!   I am role-playing. You are role-playing. If you try to correct me on this assumption, I will publicly flame you as insane.
    R*      Don't ask, don't tell.
    R?      The thought just hasn't crossed my mind!
