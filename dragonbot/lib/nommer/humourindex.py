Humour-Index (Joviality) (J*)
  So! You're about to play this really weird prank on another Dragon involving sparklies and superglue ... but you're not sure how they're going to take it? Well this tag will let you know just that!
    J+++!   Everything is a joke. I find something to laugh at everywhere I look ... and that includes you!
    J+++    There's very little I won't laugh about ... and very little I won't do to make you laugh!
    J++     Laughing is just so good for you! Even when you're being serious about something it's good to slip in the odd joke!
    J+      I appreciate humour of all kinds, but I do know when to take things seriously.
    J       I laugh at many things, but there's a time and a place for joking.
    J-      A joke a day keeps depression at bay ... but laughing out loud is bad for my health!
    J--     Some things are OK to laugh at, but many things are not. I'll take whatever you say seriously unless you put those cute little smileys by it!
    J---    I can't think of the time when I last laughed.
    J---!   Jokes, frivolity, they're all just works of the Devil!
  Modifiers:
    r       Put after the H, this indicates that one is specifying one's 'Real Life' humour index. For example Jr- indicates 'I laugh occasionally in real life.'
    v       Put after the H, this indicates that one is specifying one's 'Virtual Life' humour index. For example Jv+ indicates 'I goof around a bit on the 'net!'
    ( )     You can use both of the above in seperate tags to specify both humour indices, but you can also use a short-form method by just putting the r and v parts within parenthesis. For example Jr-Jv+ and J(r-v+) both indicate 'I don't really find much humour in real life, but I do appreciate jokes on the 'net.'
