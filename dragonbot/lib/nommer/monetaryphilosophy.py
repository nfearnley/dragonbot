Monetary-Philosophy ($*)
  Different dragons, surprisingly, have very different attitudes about their money. This tag allows you to let everyone know what your attitude is.
    $+++!   All things of value gravitate towards me. When I've got my claws on them I never let go!
    $+++    The coinage has my likeness on it. I own the whole kingdom!
    $++     Besides humans, I kill other dragons for their wealth.
    $+      Investments in human businesses. I do repossessions "CHOMP" personally!
    $       Take your hands off my hoard or I'll take your hands.
    $-      Bought up the weapons smiths with my savings. At least there's no more dragon-proof armour or vorpal swords.
    $--     Some thief stole most of it whilst I was out hunting hobbits!
    $---    I'm a philanthropist. I gave it all to the poor!
    $---!   I eschew all things of value. I don't need them! Whatever I find I give away.
