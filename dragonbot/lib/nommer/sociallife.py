Social-Life (S*)
  Some creatures live in secret, but many are open to the world about it. This element describes how open you are to the human world about your involvement with your on-line persona.
    S+++!   I have made a determined effort to advertise the fact that I'm not a human. My close friends have got used to explaining me to strangers to save them time. I'm so militant about my true identity that even the men in white coats were impressed!
    S+++    My friends' parents all know. I use my on-line name in front of total strangers regularly. I've received letter from people I've never met asking questions about how to deal with being non-human.
    S++     All of my friends know. I told my parents instead of waiting for them to find out. The local cybercaf&eacute;'s manager calls me by my on-line name.
    S+      Most of my friends know. I'd tell my parents if I thought they'd take it well. I've used my on-line name in public on occasion.
    S       A few of my friends know. I'm glad my parents have never asked me about this. I'm rather low-key but don't dodge the subject.
    S-      I don't want to be thought crazy in human life. If the subject came up, I'd tell my closest friends only.
    S--     It's something that would make me rather uncomfortable to have let out. I'm open on-line but try to keep my human side untraceable, and vice versa.
    S---    I've e-mailed only a few kindred souls I think I can trust, not telling them anything about my human life, naturally. There are great advantages to my continued silence.
    S---!   No on knows, period. I live in fear that my intolerant neighbours, colleagues, or relatives will turn me over to the Thought Police! I post only under condition of anonymity. I'm going out on a limb even assembling my Dragon Code!
