Irritability (I*)
  This tag should be considered vital - it indicates those you can have fun with and those you should be wary of!
    I+++!   You're just not going to catch me in a good mood! Live with it or you'd better like barbeque!
    I+++    I'd eat my mother if she looked at me wrong!
    I++     Come too close and you're a cinder.
    I+      Call me grumpy.
    I       I will defend my honour, but I will only attack with reason.
    I-      Just don't call me lizard lips and you should be fine.
    I--     I take everything in my stride, as opposed to my jaws!
    I---    You could stab me with a ten-foot pike, and I wouldn't blink!
    I---!   There's nothing you can do that will make me lose my cool!
  Modifiers:
    #       But when I do get angry, I hope you like barbeque!
