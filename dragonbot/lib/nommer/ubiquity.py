Ubiquity (U*)
  Many dragons have a long and noteworthy history going back hundreds, or even thousands, of years. Long before dealing with the daily grind of this human society they were shaping history! This tag shows how much you have done prior to making yourself known in the dragon community. It also shows how much of it you can remember!
    U+++!   They call me 'The Vanisher'. Odd Beholder creatures that I only vaguely remember are still fighting holy wars over me. I've lost track of the number of planets my friends and I have personally shaped the history of. I'm not a god!
    U+++    Not only do I remember most of my dozens (or hundreds) of past lives, but I remember a few things about you too!
    U++     See that book over there? I wrote that in a different life!
    U+      I can remember several past-life names, and am occasionally recognised too!
    U       I've done some soul-searching, and got real results! This isn't my first time around.
    U-      I'm pretty sure I've done something important, sometime, but I haven't got much of a clue as to what it was.
    U--     When I tried to do a past-life regression, I got a '404 Not found - Access denied'. Why don't past lives come with search engines?
    U---    Whatever it was I did, it made me end up here. I don't want to look!
    U---!   I blocked out my memories in self-defence after the incident with the Trout farm, the Spell of Growth, and the women's locker room at the Magic Academy! Total strangers occasionally give me odd looks and move to the other side of the street as I pass.
    U?      What's a past life?
    U!      This is my first life!
    U*      I've been around a bit, I'm just not saying how many times!
    U2      My name is Bono! :8)
