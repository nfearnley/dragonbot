Activity-Index (Ac*)
  Everyone spends different amounts of time on-line, and it can be nice to know just when you're likely to see someone again. This tag allows you to specify just that! Take the following descriptions as rough guides rather than hard and fast rules.
    Ac+++!   I have a T1 connection and am never off the 'net! I even order pizza across it!
    Ac+++    This is my home! I spend as many waking moments as possible on-line.
    Ac++     I'm on-line every day for about eight hours or so!
    Ac+      I'm on-line for at least two hours every day!
    Ac       I get on every day, briefly, to check my mail and the newsgroups.
    Ac-      I only get on occasionally during the week, but am here every weekend.
    Ac--     I can barely manage to connect once a week.
    Ac---    I'm lucky if I get on-line once a month!
    Ac---!   If you see me, it must be raining frogs again!
    Ac~      I go on-line when I fee like it. It may be hours, it may be months!
    Ac?      I really don't know when I'll be on-line again!
