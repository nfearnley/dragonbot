Fruitiness (Fr*)
  The very first on-line meeting place for dragons, and dragon-lovers, was the newsgroup alt.fan.dragons. It's still fondly considered to be home for many. Those who have been there for a while, or who have visibly enriched the newsgroup, or even those just appear to have been there for ages are (jokingly) called 'Fruits', whilst those still new to the AFD community are referred to as 'nuts'.
  This tag indicates the level of fruitiness, or nuttiness. There are two different standards that you can use, a time based one and an attitude based one. You are free to choose whichever of the two you prefer, and are not at liberty to specify which you have chosen to use!
  Time-based fruitiness:
    Fr+++!   I remember when humans ruled the newsgroup!
    Fr+++    I remember Dalvenjah posting regularly.
    Fr++     I've been here for a couple of years or so.
    Fr+      I've been here just over a year now.
    Fr       Old fruits know my name and what I'm like.
    Fr-      My name is known, but that's about it.
    Fr--     They're still responding to my welcome post.
    Fr---    I haven't posted yet, I'm just lurking!
    Fr---!   I've never heard of AFD!
  Attitude-based fruitiness:
    Fr+++!   I'm too fruity for my hat!
    Fr+++    I am well into the fermentation process.
    Fr++     I have accidentally been used in food fights.
    Fr+      Friends have spotted me in fruit salads.
    Fr       Squeeze me! I'm ripe!
    Fr-      I haven't fallen off the tree yet!
    Fr--     It can be said that I am very a-peel-ing!
    Fr---    A squirrel tried to hoard me the other day.
    Fr---!   I'm only a sparkle in the eye of the tree!
  Ratings common to both:
    Fr^      Have joined, left, returned, etc.
    Fr*      I got flamed off the newsgroup for yelling at Shim! :8)
  If you happen to know what sort of fruit or nut you are, you can specify it after the rating in "double quotes". Apparently Baxil (the original maintainer of the code) is a Fr+++"kiwi"!
