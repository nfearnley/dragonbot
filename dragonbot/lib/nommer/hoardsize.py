  This should need little explanation!
    H+++!   Governments quake when they hear you're going to sell!
    H+++    You really can't tell when someone steals an item!
    H++     You're comfortable, but you wouldn't mind some more.
    H+      You're not down to your last copper, but...
    H       You've got your own lair, unfurnished.
    H-      You and the bank own your lair.
    H--     The lair is rented, and cramped.
    H---    No money, no lair, at least you aren't starving!
    H---!   Look on the bright side. At least you've got friends!
