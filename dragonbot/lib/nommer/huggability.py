Huggability or Emotion (E*)
  Whether you like being emotional amongst others, or just don't want to be touched at all can be very important - to you at least. This tag can avoid many embarrasing moments!
    E+++!     If it is living or dead, I'll hug it (to death)!
    E+++      If it is living, I'll hug it freely.
    E++       I'm fairly free with my hugs, so try me!
    E+        I'm selective, to a point, but give me a hug and I'll return it.
    E         I don't mind hugs from any of my friends, but I draw the line there.
    E-        I'll accept hugs from my nearest and dearest, but no-one else.
    E--       Hugging me is something that only my mate is allowed to do!
    E---      Don't you dare hug me! I mean it!
    E---!     Don't even touch me ... in fact don't even think about touching me!
  Modifiers:
    #         When you do, expect a violent reaction!. For example E++# indicates 'I am fairly free with my hugs, and when I do expect to be bowled over!'
